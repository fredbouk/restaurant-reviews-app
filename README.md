# Restaurant Reviews App

## Project Overview

 In this project I was provided with [code](https://github.com/udacity/mws-restaurant-stage-1) for a restaurant reviews website. The code had a lot of issues. It was barely usable on a desktop browser, much less a mobile device. It also didnâ€™t include any standard accessibility features, and it didn't work offline at all. 
 
 My task was to make the site fully responsive on desktop, tablet, and mobile displays. I accomplished this with Flexbox and also made the site accessible to screen reader users.
 I also added a service worker script that caches requests and makes the site accessible when a user is offline.
